# Advantages of Splitting a Microservice

## Why should I split microservices based on the drive adapters?

### ⭐️ Scalability:
Scale components independently based on their specific workload and resource requirements.
### ⭐️ Resource Optimization:
Allocate resources (CPU, memory, etc.) more efficiently for each component.
### ⭐️ Fault Isolation:
Failures in one component don’t directly impact others, improving overall system resilience.
### Simpler Deployment:
Deploy, update, and maintain components independently without affecting the entire system.
### Technology Flexibility:
Use the best tools, frameworks, or platforms for each component (e.g., AWS Lambda for HTTP, Kafka consumer for messaging).
### Separation of Concerns:
Clear boundaries between components make the system easier to understand, develop, and test.
### Improved Maintainability:
Smaller, focused codebases are easier to debug, refactor, and extend.
### Cost Efficiency:
Optimize costs by using cost-effective solutions for each component (e.g., serverless for sporadic workloads).
### Enhanced Performance:
Tailor each component for specific performance requirements (e.g., low-latency HTTP responses, batch processing for Kafka).
